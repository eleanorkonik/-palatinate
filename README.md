snippets of a theme for obsidian

![](palatinate.png)

Sometimes people ask me about the theme I'm using. I got almost all of these files from the obsidian forums or discord and I haven't always attributed them correctly because they were for personal use, sorry. 

In case it comes up, my plugin list is:

* advanted tables
* better word count
* calendar
* dangling links
* find unlinked files
* maximize active pane
* mind map
* natural language dates
* note refactor
* obsidian git
* paste url into selection
* recent files
* shuffle
* templater
