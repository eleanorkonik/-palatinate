Palatinate is intended as a lightweight theme, suitable for either light (right side in img) or dark (left side in img) mode, that adds features to the base theme but does not change its fundamental feel.

It:

* does not require users to download any fonts. 
* supports the `<cite>` tag, intended to be used in a Markdown friendly way at the end of a blockquote for ease of attribution. (See Also: this [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2002120/citing-the-author-of-a-blockquote-using-markdown-syntax) discussion). Note: For wikilinks to work inside the cite tag, you need a blank `>` blockquote line before the `> <cite> [[wikilink]]</cite>`.
* disables ligatures for Inter in edit more so that `<!-- html comments -->` doesn’t look unbalanced. 
* uses a monospaced font for `%% comments %%`
* adds a cssclass for `longform` writing that enforces readable line width and a serif font. 
* adds a cssclass for `dailynote` that aligns the heading to the right instead of the left. 
* supports the `<aside>` tag, intended to allow text to flow around it instead of the tag being in the gutter. If you prefer your `<aside>` boxes to be in the gutter,  you’ll need to change the numbers yourself. 
* adds a minor tweak to “fix” the alignment of the top bar. 
* includes fancier blockquotes
* provides icons for files and folders
* prettifies the colors of the graph
* improves upon the native `<hr>` bar. 
* provides visually distinct headers (1-6) in a font that looks like my handwriting if I use a brush pen like in my bullet journal 
* labels the footnotes section at the end. 
* includes relationship lines for files and bullets that match the graph colors. 
* the `- [?]` block matches the default green of the admonition plugin’s `ad-question` block.
