Palatinate is intended as a lightweight theme, suitable for either light or dark mode, that adds features to the base theme but does not change its fundamental feel.

It:

* use of google fonts via the `@import` function so you don’t have to download any fonts. 
* supports the `<cite>` tag, intended to be used in a Markdown friendly way at the end of a blockquote for ease of attribution. (See Also: this [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2002120/citing-the-author-of-a-blockquote-using-markdown-syntax) discussion). Note: For wikilinks to work inside the cite tag, you need a blank `>` blockquote line before the `> <cite> [[wikilink]]</cite>`.
* disables ligatures for Inter in edit more so that `<!-- html comments -->` doesn’t look unbalanced. 
* uses a monospaced font for `%% comments %%`
* adds a cssclass for `longform` writing that enforces readable line width and a serif font. 
* adds a cssclass for `dailynote` that aligns the heading to the right instead of the left. 
* supports the `<aside>` tag, intended to allow text to flow around it instead of the tag being in the gutter. If you prefer your `<aside>` boxes to be in the gutter,  you’ll need to change the numbers yourself. 
* adds a minor tweak to “fix” the alignment of the top bar. 
* includes fancier blockquotes
* provides icons for files and folders
* prettifies the colors of the graph
* improves upon the native `<hr>` bar. 
* provides visually distinct headers (1-6) in a font that looks like my handwriting if I use a brush pen like in my bullet journal 
* labels the footnotes section at the end. 
* includes relationship lines for files and bullets that match the graph colors.
